# 🐦 Schnappy Bird

A clone of the legendary Flappy Bird game that was withdrawn by it's developer due to his guilt over the addictiveness of the game he had created. Rest assured, this clone is just as addictive.

Uses the 2D game development library Gosu.

My first endeavor into game development, for the next challenge I'll be looking into more advanced form of collision detection (Separated Axis Thereom), aiming to make it a platformer. 

N.B. all sound effects and music are home made :)
